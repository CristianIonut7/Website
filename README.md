# Personal Multi-Page Website Project

This is a personal website project structured across multiple pages, built using fundamental web technologies.

## 1. Project Description

The project is a classic website, ideal for a portfolio or personal presentation. It consists of four main sections, each with its own HTML page, and includes a responsive design for mobile devices, implemented with a "burger" menu.

## 2. Features

* **Multi-Page Structure:** The site is logically divided into four distinct pages:
    * `index.html`: The main homepage.
    * `cv.html`: A page for listing skills, education, and experience.
    * `portofolio.html`: A gallery showcasing various projects.
    * `contact.html`: A page with a contact form.
* **Responsive Design:** Uses CSS Media Queries to adapt the layout for smaller (mobile) screens.
* **"Burger" Menu:** Includes a functional mobile navigation menu controlled by JavaScript.
* **Contact Form:** The contact page features a simple form that opens the user's default email client (`mailto:`).
* **CSS Styling:** Uses CSS for layout (including Flexbox) and `hover` effects for interactivity.

## 3. Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** - Used exclusively for the "burger" menu functionality.
